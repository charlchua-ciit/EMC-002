        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Charl Daniel Chua. I have a passion for gaming and programming. Aside from that, I also indulge in multiple hobbies, such as playing the drums and swimming. Birthday, October 12, 2001. I particularly enjoy fighting games. To that extent, below are some of my favorite characters and mains across different games. All text taken from their respective Dustloop pages.</p>

            <p class="text">Johnny is a stylish swordsman who excels around the midrange with his signature Hirofumi sword style. What he lacks in defensive options, he makes up for with his ranged and often disjointed pokes that allow him to play a safe neutral game and keep opponents at a distance.</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/mitsuru.jpg" alt="mitsuru">
            <p class="text">Mitsuru Kirijo, or more simply known as Mitsuru, is a midrange monster able to completely dominate the neutral game with her huge buttons. She's able to hit characters from almost anywhere on the screen, and convert into a combo. These combos deal alright damage on their own-but by using her shadow form Mitsuru's damage can be taken to the next level. Due to her amazing neutral and strong strike/throw game, Mitsuru is considered a top tier, and Shadow Mitsuru is in contention for the best character in the game.</p>

            <p class="text">A heavy hitter who wields a massive blade with enough force to lay pressure on foes at both close quarters and midrange.

                By sacrificing a portion of his health to activate Manigance, he can drastically increase his attack power for a period of time. Albeit sacrificing part of his health for increased damage, the punishment Siegfried is able to dish out is more than enough to compensate for small portion of health.</p>
